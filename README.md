👋 Hey there, I’m Rayaan Pasha!

💻 I build websites with MERN, PHP, and more, and I’m obsessed with Data Structures and Algorithms—Graphs and Trees are my coding playground!

🌱 Currently a student at St. Joseph’s University, Bengaluru, juggling my BCA studies while mastering code and debugging my way through life.

🧠 With 2+ years of experience teaching Math and Computer Science, I can turn complex problems into clear, understandable solutions.

🤝 Always up for collaborations on cool projects, tech discussions, or a good coding joke. Let’s connect and make some tech magic together!

📬 Reach me here or on LinkedIn—I promise my response time is quicker than my latest algorithm optimization!

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I once wrote a program to solve a puzzle, and it ended up solving it in a way no one expected—sometimes the best solutions are the most unconventional!
