👋 Yello, I’m Rayaan Pasha!

💻 I make cool stuff with MERN, PHP, and more, and I ❤️ Data Structures and Algorithms. Graphs and Trees are my jam!!!

🌱 Currently a freshman at St. Joseph’s University, Bengaluru, juggling my BCA studies.

🧠 With 2+ years of experience teaching Math and Computer Science, I can turn hard problems into clear, understandable solutions.

🤝 Always up for collaborations on cool projects, tech discussions, or a good algorithm joke. Let’s connect and make some tech magic!

📬 Reach by mailing me at: mdrayaanpasha@gmail.com or on LinkedIn, I promise my response time is quicker than my latest algorithm optimization!

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Quick joke: Why do graphs don't go to party? because they couldn’t handle the constant need to “connect” with everyone!
